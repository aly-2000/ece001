<h1>Types of Artificial intelligence :</h1>

<p>Artificial Intelligence technology is classified into three categories:<br>
Narrow Artificial Intelligence (ANI), General Artificial Intelligence (AGI),<br>
and Superior Artificial Intelligence (ASI).<br></p>

<center><table border="1" width="400">
       <tr>
           <td> Artificial Narrow <br>
                Intelligence (ANI) </td>
           <td>It refers to artificial intelligence systems that can only perform specific
               tasks independently and with capabilities that mimic human capabilities. 
               This means that these systems are limited in capabilities and their capabilities
                do not go beyond the tasks designed for them. </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>  
          <td> Artificial General Intelligence: </td>
          <td> It means the ability of artificial intelligence to learn, perceive,
               understand and act just like a human by simulating human capabilities. 
                These systems will be able to build a variety of capacities and reach 
                links and generalizations across several areas, which would reduce much 
                 of the time needed to train these systems. </td>
       </tr>
       <tr>
            <td> Artificial Superintelligence: </td> 
            <td> The development of super artificial intelligence is probably the culmination 
              of research in this field.  Given that AI will be considered, when developed,
               will be the most capable form of intelligence on Earth,
              superior AI will be distinguished at all levels thanks to its superior memory,
                fast data processing and analysis, and decision-making capabilities.</td>
